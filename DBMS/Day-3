What is DBMS?
=============
-> DBMS is a software to use manage and maintain data/information with in the data base.
-> By using DBMS  software we will perform the following Operations are:
1.Creating database.
2.Creating table.
3.Inserting data(i.e. store).
4.Updaiting Data(i.e.. manipulating)
5.Selecting data(i.e. reading)
6.Deleting Data(i.e. removing)

->DBMS software will be act as an interface between user and database.
User<--->DBMS(SW)<----->DATABASE

Models Of DBMS:
===============
->There are three models in DBMS concept 
1.Hierarchical Database Management System(HDBMS).
Ex: Ims SW(Information management System).
2.Network Database Management System(NDBMS).
Ex: IDBMS SW ()Integrated DATABSE Management System).
Note:
=======
->HDBMS,NDBMS Model are out dated in real time.
3.RDBMS:(Relational database management System).
================================================
=>it is a more popular database System in real world.
=>it again classified into two modules:  
                                       1.Object relational DBMS.
                                       2.Object Oriented DBMS.

1.Object relational DBMS.
⦁	In these database we are storing the data in the form of "TABLE" FORMAT(I.E Stored data).
⦁	Table=(collection of columns and rows).
⦁	Row=(Group of columns).
⦁	Database=(Group of tables).
⦁	A row can be called as "records/tuples"
⦁	A column can be called as "Attributes/fields".
⦁	Objects relational database are completely depends on "SQL DATABASE" IN REAL TIME.
 
Ex: Oracle , MySQL, SQL server, POSTTYPE SQL,IBMDB2,..ETC.


2.Object Oriented DBMS
⦁	In these database we are Organizing data in the form of "OBJECTS" Format(i.e. Unstructured).
⦁	Objects/Unstructured:
>Audio
>Video
>Image
>Text Documents
⦁	Object oriented database are completely depends on "OPPS" CONCEPT BUT not "SQL" SO THAT THESE database are also called as " No SQL" IN REAL TIME.
Ex: Mango DB, CSSANDRS , REDIS , OBJECT DB..ETC.
